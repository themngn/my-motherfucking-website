        <h2>Simplicity is the key</h2>
        <!-- <p>
            I didn't have money for css so I used almost no styles. <br />
            I love some css but I love my money more.
        </p>
        <p>
            I didn't have money for dedicated server so I used git. <br />
            I love dedicated servers but I love my money more.<br />
            I love git too.
        </p> -->
        <p>
            There is little point in making a website look good if it's not
            going to be used. <br />
            I made this website for myself, so i don't care about how it looks. But
            i care if i will use it. 
            I have a lot of unfinished projects. And this will not be one of
            them. <br />
            It is already finished. I already using it. Yes, i will update it
            with more stuff. But i don't need to update it with styles or new
            features to make it usable, because it already is. <br />
            Also, benefits of simplicity are: <br />
            <ul>
                <li>It's fast</li>
                <li>Responsive</li>
                <li>Backward compatible</li>
                <li>It's easy to maintain</li>
                <li>Free hosting on github</li>
                <li>I don't need to make backups because i use git. So basically every time i edit something i make a backup. </li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p>I will write a blog post about this soon.</p>

        <h2>What you can't find here</h2>

            There is <b>NO EASTER EGGS</b> on this website. <br />
            I swear. I'm not lying. Don't waste your time. <br />
            This paragraph was designed as a physiological weapon to make you
            search for easter eggs. <br />
            There is none. I have no reason to lie to you. <br />
            Even if there was one, it would be a waste of time to search for
            it.<br />
            There is no value in easter eggs. Only one short burst of dopamine
            that will fade away in a second. <br />
            This paragraph doesn't contain any easter eggs or secret messages.
            <br />
            I just find people searching for non-existing easter eggs funny.
