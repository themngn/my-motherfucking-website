            The best way to learn is to teach. The best way to teach is to
            learn.

        <p>
            It isn't about me sharing knowledge with you. It's about me sharing
            knowledge with myself. About deconstructing what I've learn and
            filling the gaps i didn't even know existed. It's about me learning.
            And i know i'm not experienced enough to be a mentor for somebody
            else, but i'm experienced enough to be a mentor for myself. That's
            one of the reasons i'm doing this.
        </p>
        <p>
            But i will leave it for another day. I don't even sure if that day
            will ever come.
